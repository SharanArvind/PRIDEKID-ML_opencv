# PRIDEKID ML OpenCV Project

## Overview

This repository contains the OpenCV-based machine learning models and scripts used in the PRIDEKID project. These models are designed for tasks such as object detection and face emotion recognition, which are integral for enhancing user experience and interactions.

## Repository Structure

- `Submission.csv`: Data used for model training and evaluation.
- `face_emotion.py`: Script for detecting and analyzing facial emotions.
- `main.py`: Main script to run the OpenCV-based applications.
- `object_detection.py`: Script for detecting objects in images or videos.
- `opencv.py`: Utility functions and additional OpenCV functionalities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6+ and the necessary libraries installed:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SharanArvind/PRIDEKID-ML_opencv.git
   cd PRIDEKID-ML_opencv
   ```

2. Run the main application:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- **Object Detection**: Detect and identify objects in images or video streams.
- **Face Emotion Recognition**: Analyze and interpret facial expressions to determine emotions.
